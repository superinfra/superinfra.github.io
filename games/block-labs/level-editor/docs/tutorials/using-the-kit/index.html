    <h1 id="1-getting-the-kit-2-min-">1. Getting the kit (2 min.)</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the tutorial! First, you should download the kit. Not much you can do without it, huh? You can do that
        in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Download the .rbxm file directly:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go <a href="/assets/downloads/block-labs-level-kit.rbxm">here</a> to download the file. It should start downloading automatically.
                        <li>Open up a new file in Studio, or <a href="../../templates">use a template</a>.
                            (<code>Ctrl+N</code> or <code>Cmd+N</code> for Mac)</li>
                        <li>Right-click the Workspace in the Explorer window (View &gt; Explorer) and select
                            <code>Insert From File</code>.</li>
                        <li>Select the kit from the file explorer that appears.</li>
                        <li>With the kit selected, run this code in the command bar (View &gt; Command Bar, look at the
                            bottom of the screen):
                            <pre class="box"><code class="lang-lua">local kit = game<span class="hljs-selector-class">.Selection</span>:Get()[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
kit<span class="hljs-selector-class">.Blocks</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.Parent</span> = game<span class="hljs-selector-class">.ReplicatedStorage</span>
kit<span class="hljs-selector-class">.LevelNameHere</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.Parent</span> = workspace
</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Double-click <code>LevelNameHere</code> in <code>Workspace</code> and rename it to whatever
                            you want your level to be named. This is your level folder.</li>
                    
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Get it from the Creator Marketplace:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go <a href="">here</a> <!--TODO: Add link--> and click Get Model, then Try in Studio. </li>
                <li>Open the Toolbox (View &gt; Toolbox) and click the tab with an icon of 4 boxes.</li>
                <li>Find <code>Block Labs Kit</code> and click it to insert it. It should be the first result.</li>
                <li>With the kit selected, run this code in the command bar (View &gt; Command Bar, look at the bottom
                    of the screen):
                    <pre class="box"><code class="lang-lua">local kit = game<span class="hljs-selector-class">.Selection</span>:Get()[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
kit<span class="hljs-selector-class">.Blocks</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.Parent</span> = game<span class="hljs-selector-class">.ReplicatedStorage</span>
kit<span class="hljs-selector-class">.LevelNameHere</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.Parent</span> = workspace
</code></pre>
                    
                        <li>Double-click <code>LevelNameHere</code> in <code>Workspace</code> and rename it to whatever
                            you want your level to be named. This is your level folder.</li>
                    
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Use the plugin:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the Plugins tab in Studio.</li>
                <li>Find the <code>Block Labs Editor Plugin</code> and click <code>Insert</code>, then
                    <code>Full Kit</code>.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="1b-getting-the-plugin-optional-2-min-">1b. Getting the plugin (Optional, 2 min.)</h2>
    <p>Even though the plugin is optional, it takes less than 5 minutes to get and provides some helpful features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the kit in just two clicks</li>
        <li>Add objects without inserting the kit</li>
        <li>See this documentation without opening your browser</li>
        <li>Easily <a href="../custom-blocks">create custom blocks</a></li>
        <li>Automatically move objects into your level folder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Get the free plugin from the Creator Marketplace <a href="">here</a>! <!--TODO: More steps, add link--></p>
    <h1 id="2-adding-objects-2-min-">2. Adding objects (2 min.)</h1>
    <p>To add an object, select it and duplicate it by pressing <code>Ctrl+D</code> (or <code>Cmd+D</code> for Mac).
        Then, use the Explorer to drag the object into your level folder.</p>
    <blockquote class="box" style="color: skyblue;">
        <b>TIP:</b>
            If you have the plugin, duplicated objects will automatically be put in your level folder.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Some objects, such as <a href="../../objects/buttons">buttons</a>, have properties you can change. For example, <a
            href="../../objects/buttons/door">door buttons</a> have a 
            DoorToOpen property. To change these properties, expand the
        object by clicking the arrow next to the name and picking a property. Then, change the <code>Value</code> in the
        Properties window (View &gt; Properties).</p>
    <p>If you&#39;re confused about what all the properties do, select a property and click the
        <code>What&#39;s this?</code> button on the plugin menu. If you don&#39;t have the plugin, you can also look for
        the property on its object&#39;s page in the Properties section.</p>
    <h1 id="3-applying-your-knowledge-5-min-">3. Applying your knowledge (5 min.)</h1>
    <p>Now that you know how to add and edit objects, let&#39;s put this to use! Open Studio, press
        <code>Ctrl+N</code>/<code>Cmd+N</code> to create a new file, and add the kit. Next, you get to use your
        creativity! Lay out a map with basic Roblox parts. Change color, material, etc. using the Model tab or
        Properties window to make it look great! Don&#39;t forget to anchor everything and put it all in the level
        folder.</p>
    <blockquote class="box" style="color: limegreen;">
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
            Add parts by going to the Model tab and clicking the Part button. You can click the dropdown arrow
            underneath it to pick from other types, like cylinders, spheres, and wedges!
    </blockquote>
    <p>Once you have a good map, start adding objects to make your level... an actual level! You can do whatever you
        want, but for this tutorial, go ahead and add a button. Duplicate and drag. Put this button anywhere you want!
        Now add a door. Duplicate and drag. Put this somewhere else. Finally, add a spawner. You guessed it - duplicate
        and drag! If you&#39;d like, you can also add a <a href="../../objects/light">light</a> to get rid of those pesky
        shadows.</p>
    <p>Here&#39;s an example of what your level might look like:</p>
    <p><img width="450" alt="Example screenshot"
            src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b36ef7b-ba11-45cf-b300-9a57fd681569" /><br>
        <sup>Example screenshot</sup>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="box" style="color: skyblue;">
        <b>TIP:</b>
            You might start to notice how annoying it is to move the parts into the level folder. If you don&#39;t want
            to get the plugin for some reason, run this command in the command bar after you duplicate an object:
        <pre><code class="lang-lua"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">_</span>, v <span class="hljs-built_in">in</span> pairs(workspace:GetChildren()) <span class="hljs-built_in">do</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> v:HasTag(<span class="hljs-string">"LevelFolder"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>
       game.Selection:Get()[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>].Parent = v
   <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hopefully that wasn&#39;t too hard! Next, we need to change the properties. First, let&#39;s connect the button
        and the door together. Expand the button in the Explorer to reveal the properties. Click on DoorToOpen, then on
        the Value field in the Properties window. Your cursor should change! Now, click on the door <strong>in the
            Explorer.</strong> If you click the door in the viewport, which is the screen in the middle, you might get
        an error once you test your work!</p>
    <p>What you just changed is called an Instance value! When you try to change Instance values, you have to select
        something from the Explorer instead of typing.</p>
    <blockquote class="box">
        <b>NOTE:</b>
            An Instance, in Roblox terms, is something you add to your game to make it function. This includes parts,
            folders, scripts, and even GUI! You can use any Instance in your level except scripts, because those are
            disallowed until you become a <a href="../becoming-a-trusted-builder">Trusted Builder</a>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>It&#39;s time to playtest, but first, move the spawn into the level. Now we can go! Press <code>F5</code>. Try
        spawning a block and pushing it into the button! If you set up the properties correctly, the door will open.
        But... nothing&#39;s behind the door. That&#39;s kinda boring.</p>
    <p>Build another room behind the door so you can add an exit. Adding the exit is nice and easy: just duplicate the
        <a href="../../objects/exit">exit object</a> from the kit, and... <em>drumroll please...</em> <strong>DRAG!</strong>
        Whoa, what a plot twist! </p>
    <p>You might notice that the exit part does absolutely nothing. This is intended. After you submit, the ✨
        <em>magical developer people</em> ✨ will make it work with their ✨ <em>magical developer spells</em> ✨ so that
        you don&#39;t have to lift a finger!</p>
    <blockquote class="box" style="color: goldenrod;">
        <b>WARNING:</b>
            The exit will be invisible after review, but if you don&#39;t like that, you can add a white part with its
            material set to <code>Neon</code> and a <code>PointLight</code> Instance inside. Then just line it up with
            the exit and you&#39;ll have a glowing portal effect!
    </blockquote>
    <p>OK! Now you&#39;re done! Good job. Playtest your work and see how epic it is!</p>
    <p>See you next time! :)</p>

    <p><sup>PS: You probably noticed that the ending of this article was a bit more fun and the start was... nerdy and
            boring. The mood of this article is pretty much just whatever my mood was when I wrote it, so it&#39;s
            pretty inconsistent. Sorry about that! It'll probably get fixed at some point.</sup></p>
