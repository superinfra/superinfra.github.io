    <p>We make games that <b>don't suck.</b></p>
    <p>No pay to win, cashgrabs, or toddler junk, but games built to be fun and enjoyable. We believe in <b>quality over quantity,</b> and never force out low-effort projects just to fill a page or sell something. If it's not a game we'd actually want to play ourselves, <b>it doesn't ship.</b></p>
    <p>Everything is made with care, playtested way too much, and made to be <b>fair for everyone,</b> whether you've spent 50 dollars or none!</p>
