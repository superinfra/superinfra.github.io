    <h1 id="conveyor">Conveyor</h1>
    <p>A <strong>conveyor</strong> is an object that pushes any blocks or players on its surface in the specified
        <code>Direction</code>.</p>
    <h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
    <p>Set the <code>Direction</code> and anything that touches its surface will be moved in that direction! You can
        change also change the <code>Speed</code>. If you place a block on the first end of a conveyor and buttons on
        the other end, you can make a <a href="../../tutorials/conveyor-scripting">conveyor script</a>! These are useful for binding multiple actions to one trigger.

        <b>IMPORTANT:</b>
            A Vector3 is a set of 3 comma-separated numbers representing direction, position, and anything related to 3D
            space. The first number is the X-axis (length), the second is the Y-axis (height), and finally, the Z-axis
            (depth).
            <p></p>
        For example, if you input <code>1, 0, 0</code> and stand on the conveyor, you will be moved horizontally
            across the conveyor on the X-axis. If you input <code>1, 0, 1</code>, however, you&#39;ll be moved
            diagonally since the conveyor is now moving you on the X-axis <em>and</em> the Z-axis.
            <p></p>
